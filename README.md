A port of the RPGMaker Engine to Java for Mac and Linux support

Still a work in progress, but many features are supported. Focus is on supporting Vanilla RPG Maker VX Ace games, but adding support for additional scripts as feasible. 

Primarily created for the game [Vidar](http://vidarthegame.com/ "Vidar: The RPG Puzzler where Everybody Dies"), but can potentially be useful for other games as well.
